# Project-on-Customer-Segmentation-in-Retail-Industry

Project performed while working as an intern, for the cooperative education program for the university, at D-Sys Data Solutions Pvt. Ltd. India. 

**Introduction**

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing your customer 
base into groups based on common characteristics. The customer 
segmentation process helps you understand who your target audience 
is, refine your customer experience and reduce churn.
There are numerous benefits to dividing up your customer base 
into individual segments. Let us look at two of the major benefits in 
depth.
First, segmenting the customer base enables an organization to 
better communicate with its customers. This is especially true if the 
business services a wide range of customers as it enables the 
organization to provide a segment specific, customized experience. If 
a business only targets a single group of customers, segmentation is 
less effective.
Second, customer segmentation can aid an organization in 
identifying new business opportunities. By better understanding what 
existing customers are, an organization will be able to find new 
problems to solve — in other words, new products, and services to offer 
— while leveraging the existing customer audience.
Customer segmentation has many benefits, most of which stem 
from the ability to better understand of the audience. 
There are various methods of customer segmentation that need to 
be weighed against each other in terms of applicability and real 
benefits. They can also be combined. Few of these methods are:
Needs/Value Segmentation, RFM Segmentation, Clustering, Predictive 
Models etc.

**Problem Statement**

In the retail industry, customer segmentation plays an important 
role. There are a lot of datasets available of the European and the 
American, and due to such availability of data, there exist many 
solutions for customer segmentations available highlighting the various 
nuances of the retail industry. 
If we take the Asian region into consideration, due to the 
unavailability of proper data, there is no availability of the customer 
segmentation solutions and those which are available, are confined to 
small regions and limited data.


**Proposed Solution**

Understanding the problem, we planned to create a customer 
segmentation model specifically for the Asian region. This model 
development has been supported by the data which was be collected 
using web scrapping.
This model was be developed with RFM Segmentation method. 
This method, being the gold standard for segmentation, considers three 
core dimensions of a customer’s buying behaviour: Time since last 
purchase (Recency), purchase frequency (Frequency) and sales
(Monetary Value).
For better understanding of the outcomes of the segmentation, 
front end visualization was performed using Tableau.
